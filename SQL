To select employees whose FIRSTNAMES begin with the letter A, use:
SELECT* FROM employees WHERE FirstName LIKE 'A%'

JOIN creates a temporary table with the joined tables' data

UNION combines multiple datasets into single dataset, and removes any existing duplicates
UNION ALL , does not remove duplicates
EXAMPLE:
SELECT ID, FirstName, LastName,City FROM table1 UNION SELECT ID, FirstName,LastName,City FROM table2
if my table 2 dont have one column i can use NULL instead of arguments

INSERT INTO Employees VALUES (8, 'Anthony','Young',35)

I can update data: EXAMPLE
UPDATE Employess SET Salary=5000 WHERE ID=1

DELETE FROM Employees WHERE ID=1

Creating a Table:
EXAMPLE:
CREATE TABLE table_name
(
column_name1 data_type(size)
column_name2 data_type(size)
column_name3 data_type(size)
column_name4 data_type(size)
);
Size means how many maximum colums could be using
varchar it's a string in SQL res are the same like in other language

PRIMARY KEY meand that a column has a unique id

ALTER TABLE People ADD DateOfBirth date;
adding column with null values
DROP TABLE means deleting

ALTER TABLE is also using to rename colums
